# ðŸ§¹ Cleaner Property Card Component

**Epic**: Enhanced Property Management System  
**Phase**: 3 - Enhanced UI Components  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days  
**Depends on**: Issue #1 (Database Schema), Issue #2 (Services)

## Overview
Create a comprehensive property card specifically designed for cleaners that displays all critical information needed for successful property cleaning. This addresses the core problem of cleaners not having essential details readily available.

## Problem Statement
Cleaners currently struggle with:
- Missing or unclear access instructions (lockbox codes, smart lock codes)
- Incorrect guest counts leading to wrong linen preparation
- Hidden special requests that should be prominent
- Last-minute cancellations not clearly communicated
- Emergency contact information buried or missing
- Property-specific requirements not visible

## Requirements

### Critical Information Display
- [ ] **Guest count prominently displayed** - Primary factor for linen calculation
- [ ] **Check-in/Check-out times** - Essential for scheduling
- [ ] **Scheduled cleaning time** - When cleaner should arrive
- [ ] **Access method and codes** - Lockbox, smart lock, doorman instructions
- [ ] **Linen requirements breakdown** - Exact quantities based on guest count
- [ ] **Special areas to clean** - Pool, hot tub, BBQ area, balcony
- [ ] **WiFi credentials** - For cleaner's mobile access if needed

### Cancellation Handling
- [ ] **Cancellation overlay** - Unmistakable visual indicator
- [ ] **Cancellation timestamp** - When notice was given
- [ ] **Cancellation reason** - Why the session was cancelled
- [ ] **Short notice warning** - Less than 24 hours highlighted
- [ ] **Compensation tracking** - Future feature preparation

### Real-time Status Updates
- [ ] **Current session status** - Scheduled, confirmed, in-progress, completed
- [ ] **Today indicator** - Special highlighting for same-day sessions
- [ ] **Duration estimate** - Expected cleaning time
- [ ] **Special requests** - Owner's specific requirements
- [ ] **Guest notes** - Allergies, preferences, special needs

### Action Capabilities
- [ ] **Start cleaning button** - Begin session with confirmation
- [ ] **Report issue button** - Quick access to problem reporting
- [ ] **View details** - Access full property information
- [ ] **Emergency contact** - One-tap calling for urgent issues

## Acceptance Criteria

### Visual Design
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive design
- [ ] High contrast for outdoor visibility
- [ ] Large tap targets for work gloves
- [ ] Clear typography hierarchy
- [ ] Color coding for urgency (today, cancelled, urgent)

### Information Architecture
- [ ] Most critical info visible without scrolling
- [ ] Guest count and linen requirements prominently displayed
- [ ] Access information easily scannable
- [ ] Special requests and notes clearly differentiated
- [ ] Emergency actions readily accessible

### Interaction Design
- [ ] Smooth animations for status changes
- [ ] Loading states for all async actions
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs for critical actions
- [ ] Swipe gestures for additional actions
- [ ] Haptic feedback for important interactions

### Cancellation UX
- [ ] Cancelled sessions immediately obvious
- [ ] Cancellation details accessible but not overwhelming
- [ ] Different treatment for short-notice vs advance notice
- [ ] Clear next steps after cancellation
- [ ] Compensation information if applicable
