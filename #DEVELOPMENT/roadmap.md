### Next Development Steps

Now that you have the foundation for a cleaner-focused property management system, here are your immediate next steps:

### **1. Database Setup (Priority 1)

Run the enhanced SQL schema in your Supabase project
Update your environment variables to keep your Supabase keys secure
Test the database connection

### **2. Implement Core Workflow (Priority 1)

Replace the existing properties screen with the enhanced version
Create the missing service files (services/propertyService.ts)
Update your types file with the enhanced interfaces
Test the property loading for both owners and cleaners

### **2. Implement Core Workflow (Priority 1)** - Continued

1. Replace the existing properties screen with the enhanced version
2. Create the missing service files (`services/propertyService.ts`)
3. Update your types file with the enhanced interfaces
4. Test the property loading for both owners and cleaners

### **3. Build Essential Forms (Priority 2)**

You'll need these forms next:

**Property Creation/Edit Form:**

- Property details (address, rooms, amenities)
- Access information (codes, instructions)
- Linen requirements setup
- Photo upload functionality

**Session Management:**

- Schedule cleaning form
- Cancellation modal (already included in PropertyOwnerCard)
- Cleaner assignment interface

### **4. Real-time Communication Features (Priority 2)**

Since you mentioned cleaners getting frustrated with poor communication:

**Cleaner Updates System:**

- Photo upload for before/after shots
- Real-time issue reporting
- Status updates that notify property owners immediately
- Emergency contact system

**Notification System:**

- Push notifications for cancellations
- SMS integration for urgent issues
- Email summaries of daily schedules

### **5. Address Key Pain Points (Priority 3)**

Based on your cleaner perspective, focus on these critical improvements:

**Information Clarity:**

- Clear access instructions (no more "figure it out" situations)
- Accurate guest counts and linen requirements
- Special cleaning requirements prominently displayed
- Emergency contacts readily available

**Last-Minute Changes:**

- Penalty system for short-notice cancellations
- Automatic compensation calculations
- Clear escalation process for disputes

**Quality Control:**

- Photo documentation requirements
- Completion checklists
- Rating system that works both ways

### **6. Mobile-First Features (Priority 3)**

Since cleaners work on-site:

- Offline mode for property details
- GPS integration for property locations
- One-tap emergency contacts
- Voice notes for updates

### **Implementation Timeline**

**Week 1-2: Foundation**

- Set up database
- Implement enhanced property cards
- Basic CRUD operations for properties
- Role-based access working

**Week 3-4: Communication**

- Real-time updates system
- Photo upload functionality
- Notification system
- Cancellation workflow

**Week 5-6: Refinement**

- Advanced filtering and search
- Performance optimization
- Error handling improvements
- User experience polish

### **Critical Success Metrics**

Track these to ensure you're solving the real problems:

1. **Cancellation lead time** - Are owners giving more notice?
2. **Issue resolution time** - How quickly are problems addressed?
3. **Information accuracy** - Fewer "surprises" for cleaners?
4. **Cleaner satisfaction scores** - Are they happier with the process?
5. **Property owner retention** - Are they getting better results?

### **Quick Wins to Implement First**

1. **Same-day cancellation alerts** - Big red warnings for short notice
2. **Access code prominence** - Never buried in small text again  
3. **Photo upload on completion** - Proof of work for protection
4. **Emergency contact buttons** - One-tap calling when things go wrong
5. **Linen counter** - Clear visual of exactly what's needed
