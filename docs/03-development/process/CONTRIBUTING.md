### Development Workflow

1. **Create Feature Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Follow Existing Patterns**
   - Check `.github/instructions/` for component and service patterns
   - Use TypeScript throughout
   - Follow the existing code style

3. **Update Documentation**

   ```

5. **Commit with Proper Format**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "FEATURE: Brief description (affects: user_role)

   - Specific change 1
   - Specific change 2
   - Business impact/value

   Docs updated: file1.md, file2.md"
   ```

### Documentation Workflow

When updating docs, use this checklist from `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`:

- **New features**: Update CHANGELOG, ROADMAP, USER_WORKFLOW_ANALYSIS, VISUAL_WORKFLOW_DIAGRAMS
- **Bug fixes**: Update CHANGELOG, INTERACTIVE_TESTING_RESULTS
- **Infrastructure**: Update CHANGELOG, EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY (if impactful)

## üéØ Pull Request Process

### PR Requirements

1. **Clear Description**: Explain what changed and why
2. **Business Impact**: How does this benefit users?
3. **Documentation Updated**: Which docs were updated?
4. **Testing Completed**: How was this tested?

### PR Template

We provide a PR template that covers:

- Summary of changes
- Business impact
- Documentation updates
- Testing checklist
- AI context recording

### Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: GitHub Actions will run type checking
2. **Documentation Review**: Ensure all docs are updated
3. **Business Impact**: Validate the change aligns with roadmap
4. **Code Quality**: Check adherence to existing patterns

## üêõ Reporting Issues

### Issue Types

We have templates for:

- **üêõ Bug Reports**: Something isn't working
- **üí° Feature Requests**: New functionality ideas
- **üìö Documentation**: Documentation improvements
- **üîß Technical Debt**: Code quality improvements

### Before Opening an Issue

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Avoid duplicates
2. **Review Current Status**: Check INTERACTIVE_TESTING_RESULTS.md
3. **Use Appropriate Template**: Choose the right issue type

## ü§ñ AI Development Partner

This project uses GitHub Copilot as a technical co-founder:

- **Instructions**: See `.github/instructions/` for AI guidance
- **Business Context**: AI understands cleaning workflows and user roles
- **Code Patterns**: AI follows established component and service patterns
- **Natural Language**: Describe features in plain English

### Working with AI

1. **Reference Business Context**: Mention user roles (cleaner, property_owner, co_host)
2. **Use Existing Patterns**: AI knows our component and service structures
3. **Be Specific**: Clear requirements get better implementations
4. **Iterate**: AI can refine and improve based on feedback
