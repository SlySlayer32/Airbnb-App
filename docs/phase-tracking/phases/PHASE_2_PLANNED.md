**Timeline**: 2 weeks  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 session management  

**What It Does**:
- Calendar view of all cleanings
- Drag-and-drop rescheduling
- Recurring cleaning schedules
- Multi-property day planning
- Cleaner availability blocking
- Automatic conflict detection

**Technical Approach**:
- React Native Calendars library
- Conflict detection algorithm in service layer
- Recurring schedule cron job (Supabase Edge Function)

**Business Value**: Owners save time scheduling, cleaners have predictable schedules, fewer conflicts

### 3. Team Performance Analytics (Medium Priority)
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Timeline**: 1 week  
**Dependencies**: Historical session data  

**What It Does**:
- Cleaner efficiency metrics (avg time per clean)
- On-time arrival percentage
- Photo compliance rate
- Issue report frequency
- Quality ratings (future)
- Trend charts (weekly/monthly)

**Technical Approach**:
- Supabase Edge Function for aggregations
- Victory Native (React Native charts)
- Cached calculations updated daily

**Business Value**: Owners identify top performers, coach struggling cleaners, data-driven decisions

### 4. Invoice Generation Automation (Medium Priority)
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Timeline**: 1 week  
**Dependencies**: Financial data structure  

**What It Does**:
- Auto-generate invoices from completed sessions
- Calculate time worked (excluding breaks)
- Group by pay period (weekly/bi-weekly)
- PDF export for records
- Payment status tracking

**Technical Approach**:
- Supabase Edge Function for generation
- React Native PDF library for export
- Scheduled job for automatic creation

**Business Value**: Reduces admin work, accurate billing, professional invoices

---

### 5. Enhanced Maintenance Workflow (Medium Priority)
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Timeline**: 1 week  
**Dependencies**: Basic issue reporting  

**What It Does**:
- Assign issues to contractors
- Track resolution progress
- Add photo documentation
- Status updates via notifications
- Issue categories and priorities
- Property maintenance history

**Technical Approach**:
- New maintenance_tickets table
- Contractor role support
- File photo attachments
- Status change notifications

**Business Value**: Problems get resolved faster, better property maintenance, reduced owner stress

---

### 6. Historical Reporting System (Low Priority)
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Timeline**: 1 week  
**Dependencies**: Historical data accumulation  

**What It Does**:
- Property cleaning history
- Cost trends over time
- Cleaner performance trends
- Issue frequency by property
- Export to CSV/PDF

**Technical Approach**:
- Aggregation queries with date ranges
- Chart.js or Victory Native for visualizations
- CSV export library

**Business Value**: Owners make informed decisions, identify problem properties, optimize costs

## üöÄ Recommended Build Sequence

### Week 1: Photo & Scheduling Foundation
1. Photo storage optimization (3 days)
2. Advanced scheduling backend (2 days)

**Why First**: Builds on Phase 1 systems, high user value

---

### Week 2: Scheduling UI & Analytics
1. Calendar UI implementation (3 days)
2. Team performance dashboard (2 days)

**Why Second**: Completes scheduling feature, adds owner value

---

### Week 3: Financial & Maintenance
1. Invoice automation (3 days)
2. Enhanced maintenance workflow (2 days)

**Why Third**: Operational efficiency, reduces admin burden

---

### Week 4: Reporting & Polish
1. Historical reporting (3 days)
2. Integration testing and polish (2 days)

**Why Last**: Nice-to-have insights, final quality pass

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Blockers

### Technical Risks
- **Photo compression**: May need performance testing on older devices
- **Calendar library**: Ensure mobile-friendly and performant
- **Chart rendering**: Can be slow with large datasets

**Mitigation**: Test early, use lazy loading, optimize queries

### Business Risks
- **Feature creep**: Resist adding unplanned features mid-phase
- **Scope expansion**: Stick to planned timeline

**Mitigation**: Regular check-ins, strict scope management
