## Business Problem Solved

Cleaners need intelligent, context-aware status guidance throughout their workday. Currently, the status banner shows static states that don't adapt to real-time conditions, time constraints, or session progress.

## User Story

As a **cleaner**, I want the status banner to intelligently guide me through my workday so that I know exactly what to do next and when to take action.

As a **property_owner**, I want cleaners to receive smart guidance that helps them stay on schedule and complete work efficiently.

## Implementation Plan

### TypeScript Types Required
- [ ] `BannerState` enum for all possible banner states
- [ ] `BannerStateContext` interface for state machine input
- [ ] `BannerTransition` interface for state change logic
- [ ] Enhanced banner state management types

### Services Layer Changes
- [ ] Enhanced `BannerStateService` with intelligent state machine
- [ ] Time-based state calculation logic
- [ ] Session state integration for smart transitions
- [ ] State transition validation and error handling

### Components Required
- [ ] Enhanced `CleanerStatusBanner` with state machine integration
- [ ] Smart state transition animations
- [ ] Context-aware banner content and actions
- [ ] Time-sensitive state indicators

### Database/Supabase Changes
- [ ] No database changes required (uses existing session data)

### Business Rules Enforcement
- [ ] Time-based automatic state changes (morning prep, lunch break, end of day)
- [ ] Session state integration (scheduled → ready → active → complete)
- [ ] Priority-based state transitions (urgent sessions override normal flow)
- [ ] Break state management (pause → break → resume)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Banner state machine function (pure function) implemented
- [ ] Unit tests for all state transitions
- [ ] Integration with existing status banner component
- [ ] Time-based automatic state changes working
- [ ] Session state integration complete
- [ ] Error handling for invalid state transitions
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Success Metrics

**Business Impact**: 
- Cleaners receive intelligent, context-aware guidance throughout workday
- Reduces confusion about what to do next
- Improves time management and schedule adherence
- Provides professional, adaptive user experience

**Technical Quality Gates**:
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] All existing patterns followed
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Unit tests completed
- [ ] State machine logic validated
