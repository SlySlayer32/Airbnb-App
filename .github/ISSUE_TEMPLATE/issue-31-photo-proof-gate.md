## Business Problem Solved

Property owners need visual proof that cleaning sessions are completed properly. Currently, cleaners can mark sessions complete without providing photo evidence, leading to disputes and quality control issues.

## User Story

As a **property_owner**, I want cleaners to provide photo evidence before marking sessions complete so that I can verify cleaning quality and resolve any disputes.

As a **cleaner**, I want a clear photo proof system so that I know exactly what photos are required and can complete sessions efficiently.

## Implementation Plan

### TypeScript Types Required
- [ ] `PhotoProofRequirement` interface in `/types/index.ts`
- [ ] `PhotoProofStatus` enum for tracking photo states
- [ ] Enhanced `CleaningSession` interface with photo proof fields

### Services Layer Changes
- [ ] `photoProofService.ts` - New service for photo proof management
- [ ] Enhanced `cleaningSessionService.ts` with photo validation methods
- [ ] Photo requirement calculation logic

### Components Required
- [ ] `PhotoProofGate.tsx` - Main photo proof component
- [ ] `PhotoCapturePlaceholder.tsx` - Basic photo capture UI
- [ ] Enhanced `CleanerActiveSessionCard.tsx` with photo proof integration

### Database/Supabase Changes
- [ ] Enhanced `cleaning_sessions` table with photo proof fields
- [ ] Photo proof validation logic in RLS policies

### Business Rules Enforcement
- [ ] Minimum photo requirements per session type
- [ ] Photo categories (before/after, specific areas)
- [ ] Completion blocking until photos provided
- [ ] Photo proof validation before session completion

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Photo proof gate blocks completion until required photos provided
- [ ] Clear photo requirements displayed to cleaners
- [ ] Basic photo capture placeholder (no storage yet)
- [ ] Integration with existing completion flow
- [ ] Error handling for photo capture failures
- [ ] Role-based access control implemented
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Success Metrics

**Business Impact**: 
- Ensures 100% of completed sessions have photo evidence
- Reduces disputes between cleaners and property owners
- Provides visual quality control for cleaning services
- Foundation for advanced photo management in Phase 2

**Technical Quality Gates**:
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] All existing patterns followed
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Testing completed
