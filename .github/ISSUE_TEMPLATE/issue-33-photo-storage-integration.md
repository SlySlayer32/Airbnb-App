## Business Problem Solved

Cleaners need to upload real photos to Supabase Storage instead of mock placeholders. Currently, the photo proof system uses mock URLs and doesn't actually store photos, preventing real photo validation and property owner verification.

## User Story

As a **cleaner**, I want to capture and upload real photos to prove cleaning completion so that property owners can verify the quality of my work.

As a **property_owner**, I want to see actual photos of completed cleaning work so that I can verify quality and resolve any disputes with visual evidence.

## Implementation Plan

### TypeScript Types Required
- [ ] `PhotoUploadResult` interface for upload responses
- [ ] `PhotoMetadata` interface for stored photo information
- [ ] Enhanced `PhotoProofRequirement` with real storage fields
- [ ] `StorageBucketConfig` interface for Supabase storage configuration

### Services Layer Changes
- [ ] `photoStorageService.ts` - New service for Supabase Storage integration
- [ ] Enhanced `photoProofService.ts` with real storage methods
- [ ] Photo upload, download, and validation methods
- [ ] Storage bucket management and file organization

### Components Required
- [ ] Enhanced `PhotoProofGate.tsx` with real camera integration
- [ ] `PhotoUploadProgress.tsx` - Upload progress indicator
- [ ] `PhotoPreview.tsx` - Real photo preview component
- [ ] Enhanced photo capture with actual camera functionality

### Database/Supabase Changes
- [ ] Create `cleaning_photos` storage bucket in Supabase
- [ ] Add `photo_metadata` table for photo information
- [ ] Implement RLS policies for photo access control
- [ ] Photo validation and storage triggers

### Business Rules Enforcement
- [ ] Photo file size limits and format validation
- [ ] Automatic photo compression for mobile uploads
- [ ] Photo metadata storage with session and property information
- [ ] Real-time photo upload progress tracking
- [ ] Photo deletion and cleanup policies

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Real photo capture using device camera
- [ ] Photos uploaded to Supabase Storage bucket
- [ ] Photo metadata stored in database
- [ ] Upload progress tracking and error handling
- [ ] Photo validation and completion blocking
- [ ] Photo preview and management interface
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Success Metrics

**Business Impact**: 
- Real photo evidence for all cleaning completions
- Property owners receive actual visual proof of work quality
- Eliminates disputes with concrete photo evidence
- Professional photo documentation system

**Technical Quality Gates**:
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] All existing patterns followed
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Photo upload/download working
- [ ] Storage security validated
