# How to View Your Airbnb Cleaning App

## ✅ Your App Is Running Successfully!

The `POST http://localhost:8081/_expo/touch 409 (Conflict)` error is **harmless** - it's just Expo's onboarding tutorial trying to create files that already exist. Your app is working fine!

## 📱 How to Access Your App

### Option 1: Web Browser (Recommended for Testing)
**In the Expo DevTools page that just opened:**
1. Look for a button that says **"Press w to open web"** or click the **Web** button
2. OR manually visit: `http://localhost:8081/`
3. Your app should load in the browser

**OR via Terminal:**
```powershell
npx expo start --web
```

### Option 2: Android Emulator
**In the Expo DevTools page:**
1. Click **"Press a to open Android"** or click the **Android** button
2. Make sure you have Android Studio installed with an emulator running

**OR via Terminal:**
```powershell
npx expo start --android
```

### Option 3: iOS Simulator (Mac Only)
**In the Expo DevTools page:**
1. Click **"Press i to open iOS"** or click the **iOS** button
2. Requires Xcode installed on Mac

**OR via Terminal:**
```powershell
npx expo start --ios
```

### Option 4: Expo Go App on Your Phone
1. Download **Expo Go** from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android)
2. In the Expo DevTools page, scan the QR code with:
   - **iOS**: Camera app
   - **Android**: Expo Go app's QR scanner
3. Your app will load on your phone

## 🎯 What You Should See

When the app loads successfully, you should see:

1. **Login Screen** (if not logged in)
2. **OR Dashboard** with:
   - "Good morning, [Name]!"
   - Demo mode banner (if using demo mode)
   - Dashboard stats
   - Quick actions
   - Recent activity

## 🐛 If You Still See "Welcome to Expo"

The page you're seeing is the **Expo DevTools** (control panel), not your app. You need to:

1. Click one of the platform buttons (Web, Android, iOS)
2. OR use the keyboard shortcuts (w, a, i)
3. OR visit the direct URLs listed above

## 🔥 Quick Test (Web Version)

Run this in your terminal:
```powershell
npx expo start --web
```

This will automatically open your app in the web browser.

## ✅ Confirming It Works

Once you see your app (not the DevTools page), you should:
1. See the login screen or dashboard
2. Be able to navigate between tabs
3. See your profile information
4. See properties, schedule, etc.

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

If you're still stuck, let me know:
1. What you see on the screen (screenshot helps!)
2. Are you using web, Android, iOS, or Expo Go?
3. Any error messages in the browser console (F12 -> Console tab)
