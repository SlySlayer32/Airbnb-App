# Test File Example

This demonstrates how Cursor rules work with the Airbnb Cleaning Management Platform.

## Rule Structure

Each `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/` contains:
- **description**: What the rule covers
- **globs**: File patterns this rule applies to
- **alwaysApply**: Whether to apply to all files or only matching patterns

## Example Usage

When working on components, Cursor will automatically apply:
- Component development patterns
- Design system values
- Error handling rules
- Performance guidelines

## Business Context

This app helps property owners manage cleaning teams for Airbnb properties, with three main user roles:
- **property_owner**: Manages properties and schedules
- **cleaner**: Receives assignments and updates progress  
- **co_host**: Limited management capabilities

## Key Rules

- Always use TypeScript types
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Handle all error states
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Use role-based access control
