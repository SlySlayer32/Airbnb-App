## üîÑ DOCUMENTATION WORKFLOW AUTOMATION

**For EVERY code change request**:

1. **AUTOMATICALLY** identify which documentation needs updating
2. **AUTOMATICALLY** update CHANGELOG.md with proper entry
3. **AUTOMATICALLY** update GitHub issue status if major feature
4. **AUTOMATICALLY** update developer handoff guide if architectural change
