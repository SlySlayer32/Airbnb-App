# Cursor Rules Setup Guide

This folder contains rule files for Cursor in multiple formats:

## Files Overview

### 📋 `.cursorrules` (Root Level)
**What it is**: Airbnb app-specific rules  
**Where it is**: Project root - Auto-loaded by Cursor  
**What it contains**:
- App description (cleaning management platform)
- 5 critical business rules (cleaning window, cancellation, privacy, photo proof, linen calc)
- Tech stack (React Native, Expo, Supabase, TypeScript)
- Code patterns and examples
- File organization structure
- Design system (colors, spacing, naming)
- **📚 Complete docs/ folder navigation** (CRITICAL - tells AI to read docs first)
- When to read which docs for different tasks
- How to use documentation as source of truth

**Status**: ✅ Active (Cursor reads this automatically)

---

### 📋 `.cursor/rules/project-rules.mdc`
**What it is**: Same as `.cursorrules` but in .mdc format  
**Where it is**: `.cursor/rules/` folder  
**Status**: ✅ Active (`alwaysApply: true` makes it auto-load)  
**Purpose**: Backup format for newer Cursor versions

---

### 👤 `.cursor/USER_RULES.md`
**What it is**: Non-technical founder communication style  
**Where it goes**: Cursor Settings → User Rules (manual copy)  
**What it contains**:
- **📚 Documentation-first approach** (CRITICAL - read docs before starting)
- Plain language communication standards
- Complete code delivery requirements
- Strategic development guidance
- GitHub issue/PR tracking format
- Quality assurance checklist
- Response structure template

**Use this when**: Working on ANY project (global settings)  
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs manual setup (copy to Cursor Settings)

---

## Setup Status

### ✅ Project Rules - Already Active!

**No action needed** - Project rules are automatically loaded from:
1. `.cursorrules` (root level)
2. `.cursor/rules/project-rules.mdc` (with `alwaysApply: true`)

Both files are identical (kept in sync for compatibility). Cursor will read these automatically.

---

### ⚠️ User Rules - Manual Setup Required

**You need to copy this to Cursor Settings** for global communication style:

#### Step 1: Open Cursor Settings
- Press `Ctrl+,` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+,` (Mac)
- Or go to: File → Preferences → Settings

#### Step 2: Navigate to Rules Section
- In settings search bar, type: "rules"
- Look for section labeled: **"Cursor Rules for AI"** or **"Rules"**
- You'll see a text box labeled **"User Rules"**

#### Step 3: Copy User Rules
1. Open `.cursor/USER_RULES.md`
2. Select all content (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A)
3. Copy (Ctrl+C / Cmd+C)
4. Paste into **"User Rules"** text box in Cursor Settings
5. Click "Save" or just close (auto-saves)

**That's it!** User rules now work across ALL your projects.

## What's the Difference?

| Aspect | Project Rules | User Rules |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| **Scope** | This Airbnb app only | All your projects |
| **Focus** | Technical patterns, business logic | Communication style |
| **Contains** | App specifics, code examples | How AI should talk to you |
| **Changes when** | App evolves (new features) | Rarely (your preferences) |
| **Travels with** | This project workspace | Your Cursor installation |

---

## How They Work Together

When you work on this Airbnb app:
1. **User Rules** tell AI: "Read docs first, explain in plain language, give complete code, suggest next steps"
2. **Project Rules** tell AI: "This is a cleaning app with 4-hour windows, use TypeScript, follow these patterns, and here's the complete docs/ folder structure to reference"
3. **Combined**: AI acts as a strategic technical lead who:
   - ✅ Reads documentation before starting any work
   - ✅ Uses docs as source of truth
   - ✅ Speaks plainly without jargon
   - ✅ Knows your app deeply through comprehensive documentation
   - ✅ Proactively suggests what to build next based on roadmap docs

## Testing the Setup

After applying both rules, start a new chat and try:

```
"Add a button to the cleaner dashboard that shows today's cleaning count"
```

**What you should see (Documentation-First Behavior)**:
✅ **Reads docs first**: "I checked `docs/AI-README.md` and `docs/manifests/COMPONENTS.md`..."
✅ **Cites documentation**: "According to `docs/core/BUSINESS_RULES.md`, cleaners cannot see financial data..."
✅ **Confirms in plain language**: "We're building a counter display so cleaners can see how many cleanings they have today"
✅ **Architecture check**: "This integrates with: CleanerDashboard component and cleaningSessionService"
✅ **Complete working code** (no TODOs)
✅ **Follows existing patterns**: Uses same styling as other dashboard components
✅ **Uses correct design system**: Colors, spacing, borderRadius from project rules
✅ **Business rules enforced**: Doesn't show any financial information
✅ **Testing steps**: Clear steps to verify it works
✅ **Suggests next step**: "The logical next development step is [X] because [reason]"
✅ **Mentions GitHub issue**: "I'll create issue: 'Cleaner - View Today's Job Count'"

**What's Different With Documentation-First Approach**:
- AI reads relevant docs BEFORE writing code
- AI cites which docs it consulted
- AI catches conflicts between request and documented patterns
- AI knows what already exists (from manifests)
- AI knows what to build next (from phase tracking)
- AI follows established patterns automatically

## Updating the Rules

### When to Update Project Rules
- Adding new business rules
- Changing tech stack
- New component patterns
- Updated design system

**How**: Edit `.cursor/PROJECT_RULES.md`, then re-copy to Cursor Settings

### When to Update User Rules
- You want AI to communicate differently
- New workflow preferences (like code review)
- Different project management style

**How**: Edit `.cursor/USER_RULES.md`, then re-copy to Cursor Settings

---

## Troubleshooting

### "AI isn't following the rules"
- **Solution**: Check both rule boxes have content
- Sometimes Cursor needs restart after big rule changes
- Try: Close Cursor → Reopen → Start new chat

### "Rules are too long"
- **Solution**: They're comprehensive by design
- AI reads these fast (< 1 second)
- More detail = better behavior

### "I want different rules per project"
- **Solution**: That's what Project Rules are for!
- User Rules stay the same (your communication style)
- Project Rules change per project (tech specifics)

## Version Control

These files are in git for:
1. **Backup**: Never lose your carefully crafted rules
2. **Sharing**: Share with team members or other founders
3. **History**: Track how rules evolved over time
4. **Reference**: Easy to copy when setting up new computer

---

## Need Help?

If AI behavior seems off:
1. Verify both rules are in Cursor Settings
2. Check for any typos when copying
3. Restart Cursor
4. Try a fresh chat window
