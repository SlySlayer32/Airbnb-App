# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Setup

This workspace has Playwright MCP server configured for web browsing and research capabilities.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows GitHub Copilot to interact with external tools and services. The Playwright MCP server enables Copilot to:

- üåê Browse web pages and extract content
- üîç Search Google for documentation
- üìÑ Navigate through links and gather information
- üìä Extract structured data from websites

## Configuration

The Playwright MCP server is configured in `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
"github.copilot.chat.mcp.servers": {
  "playwright": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
  }
}
```

## Usage in Chat Modes

Your **Beast Mode 3.1** chat mode (`vscode-userdata:/User/prompts/beastmode.chatmode.md`) is configured to use Playwright for web research.

When you use Beast Mode, Copilot can automatically:
- Fetch URLs you provide
- Search Google for package documentation
- Browse documentation sites
- Follow links to gather comprehensive information

## How to Use

1. **Activate Beast Mode**: Select your chat mode in the Copilot chat
2. **Provide a task**: Ask Copilot to research something
3. **Let it work**: Copilot will use Playwright to browse the web autonomously

### Example Prompts:

```
Search Google for the latest Supabase React Native best practices
```

```
Browse the Expo Router documentation and find examples of nested layouts
```

```
Research how to implement push notifications with Expo and Supabase
```

## MCP Server Lifecycle

- **Auto-start**: Configured with `"chat.mcp.autoStart": "newAndOutdated"`
- **First use**: The MCP server will download and start automatically on first use
- **Updates**: Will automatically use `@latest` version via npx

## Troubleshooting

If the Playwright MCP server isn't working:

1. Check VS Code Output panel ‚Üí "MCP Servers" for errors
2. Ensure you have Node.js installed (required for npx)
3. Restart VS Code to reinitialize MCP servers
4. Check network connectivity (MCP downloads packages on demand)

## Security

- MCP servers run with the same permissions as VS Code
- The Playwright MCP server can browse any public website
- Be cautious when browsing untrusted sites
- MCP access is set to "all" in settings (can be restricted if needed)
