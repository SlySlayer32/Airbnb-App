## üéØ Current Clean State

Your documentation now presents a **consistent story** across all materials:

1. **Business Documents**: Focus on marketplace opportunity and live tracking advantage
2. **Technical Documents**: Preserve implementation details with correct business context  
3. **Process Documents**: Maintain development workflow and contribution guidelines
4. **Archive**: Historical reference without current positioning conflicts

## üìà Next Steps Recommendation

1. **Use GitHub Issues as roadmap** - They contain the correct marketplace strategy
2. **Reference EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md for investor materials** - Reflects accurate positioning  
3. **Archive remains for reference** - Historical context preserved but not active guidance
4. **All future documentation** should reflect marketplace positioning, not property management

- Mixed investor messaging
- Confused development priorities  
- Inconsistent competitive strategy
