## üí¨ Communication Principles

### How to Talk to AI About This Project

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Use plain English to describe what you want
- Mention which user role is affected (property_owner, cleaner, co_host)
- Describe the business problem, not technical implementation
- Reference existing features for comparison
- Be specific about expected behavior

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Use technical jargon unless necessary
- Assume AI knows about recent conversations (always provide context)
- Ask for partial implementations (always request complete solutions)
- Skip mentioning user roles or permissions

### Example Conversation Starters

**Good**:
> "I want cleaners to see a list of properties they're assigned to, with access codes displayed prominently so they can get in quickly."

**Better**:
> "I want cleaners to see a list of properties they're assigned to, with access codes displayed prominently so they can get in quickly. This should work similar to how the owner property list works, but show different information. Cleaners should also see WiFi passwords and cleaning supply locations."

## üöÄ Feature Requests

### Template 1: New Feature (Simple)
```
I want to add [feature name] for [user role(s)].

What it should do:
- [Specific behavior 1]
- [Specific behavior 2]
- [Specific behavior 3]

Why this matters:
[Business value explanation]

Similar to:
[Reference existing feature if applicable]
```

**Example**:
```
I want to add a "favorite properties" feature for cleaners.

What it should do:
- Cleaners can mark properties as favorites by tapping a star icon
- Favorite properties appear at the top of their property list
- They can unfavorite by tapping the star again

Why this matters:
Cleaners often work at the same properties repeatedly. This helps them find their regular properties faster, saving time.

Similar to:
Like how the property list already shows properties, but with a star icon and sorting by favorites first.
```

---

### Template 2: New Feature (Complex)
```
I want to add [feature name] for [user role(s)].

User Story:
As a [role], I want to [action], so that [benefit]

What it should do:
1. [Step 1 of user flow]
2. [Step 2 of user flow]
3. [Step 3 of user flow]

Business Rules:
- [Rule 1 to enforce]
- [Rule 2 to enforce]

Permissions:
- [Who can view]
- [Who can edit]
- [Who can delete]

Why this matters:
[Business value explanation]

Edge Cases to Handle:
- [Edge case 1]
- [Edge case 2]
```

**Example**:
```
I want to add a "cleaning quality rating" system for property owners.

User Story:
As a property owner, I want to rate completed cleanings, so that I can track cleaner performance and identify training needs.

What it should do:
1. After a cleaning is marked complete, owner gets a notification to rate it
2. Owner opens the completed cleaning and sees a rating modal
3. Owner selects 1-5 stars and optionally adds written feedback
4. Rating is saved and visible to owner only (not to cleaner)
5. Average rating per cleaner is shown on team management screen

Business Rules:
- Ratings can only be given within 48 hours of completion
- Once submitted, ratings cannot be changed
- Cleaners never see individual ratings (only aggregate score)

Permissions:
- Property owners can rate any cleaning on their properties
- Co-hosts can view ratings but not submit new ones
- Cleaners cannot see ratings at all

Why this matters:
Owners need to track quality over time and identify which cleaners consistently deliver good work vs which need coaching.

Edge Cases to Handle:
- What if owner never rates? (Don't require it, but send reminder after 24 hours)
- What if owner rates the same cleaning twice? (Show error: already rated)
- What if cleaning was cancelled? (Don't allow rating)
```

When This Happens:
Always happens when trying to complete any session
```

---

## üîç Code Understanding

### Template: Explain How Something Works
```
Explain how [feature/component/service] works from the [user perspective / technical perspective].

Specifically, I want to understand:
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]
- [Question 3]

Context:
[Why you need to understand this]
```

**Example**:
```
Explain how the cleaning session lifecycle works from the cleaner perspective.

Specifically, I want to understand:
- What happens when a cleaner marks themselves as "arrived"?
- What notifications get sent and when?
- How does the status change from scheduled ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed?
- What data gets recorded at each step?

Context:
I want to add a "pause session" feature and need to understand the current flow first.
```

---

### Template: Find Code Location
```
Where is the code that handles [specific functionality]?

What I'm looking for:
[Description of the functionality]

What I plan to do:
[Why you need to find it]
```

**Example**:
```
Where is the code that handles calculating linen requirements based on guest count?

What I'm looking for:
The function that takes a guest count and returns how many towels, sheets, etc. are needed

What I plan to do:
I want to modify it to also calculate pool towels for properties with pools
```

---

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring

### Template: Improve Existing Code
```
Improve [component/service/function] to follow our patterns without changing functionality.

Current Issues:
- [Issue 1]
- [Issue 2]

What Should Stay the Same:
[Functionality that must not break]

What Can Change:
[Code organization, naming, patterns]
```

**Example**:
```
Improve the CleanerPropertyCard component to follow our patterns without changing functionality.

Current Issues:
- Uses inline styles instead of StyleSheet
- Doesn't have proper error handling
- Missing loading state
- Doesn't follow our standard card design

What Should Stay the Same:
- All displayed information (access codes, WiFi, etc.)
- The onPress behavior
- The overall layout

What Can Change:
- Code organization
- Style definitions
- Error handling approach
- Loading state implementation
```

---

### Template: Split Large Component
```
Split [large component] into smaller, reusable components.

Current Component:
[Component name and file path]

Why Split:
- [Reason 1: e.g., too long, hard to maintain]
- [Reason 2: e.g., parts could be reused]

Suggested Structure:
[How you think it could be organized]
```

**Example**:
```
Split CleaningUpdates component into smaller, reusable components.

Current Component:
components/CleaningUpdates.tsx (400+ lines)

Why Split:
- Component is over 400 lines long
- Update list and message input could be separate
- Update cards are defined inline and could be extracted
- Hard to find specific functionality

Suggested Structure:
- CleaningUpdates.tsx (main container)
- CleaningUpdateList.tsx (displays update feed)
- CleaningUpdateCard.tsx (individual update)
- CleaningMessageInput.tsx (message compose area)
```

---

## üìù Documentation

### Template: Document Changes
```
Document the changes made to [files/features] in business terms.

What Changed:
[List of modified files or features]

```

**Example**:
```
Document the changes made to the photo proof system in business terms.

What Changed:
- PhotoProofGate component
- photoProofService
- cleaningSessionService (completion flow)

Target Audience:
Non-technical founder explaining feature to investors

Level of Detail:
High-level overview focusing on business value, not technical implementation
```

---

### Template: Create User Guide
```
Create a user guide for [feature] for [user role].

Include:
- How to access the feature
- Step-by-step instructions
- Screenshots/descriptions of each screen
- Common questions
- Tips and best practices
```

**Example**:
```
Create a user guide for the cleaning session workflow for cleaners.
